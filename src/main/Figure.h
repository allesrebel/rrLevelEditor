    * Parameter: bool leader is true if the camera is to follow the this instance of

    * by the player), false otherwise. Default value is false.
    *
    * Parameter: Resolves resolve describes the collision resolution action if collided
    * with. Default is BOUNDARY.
    *
    * Parameter: double speed is the movement speed of the Figure in terms of percentage
    * of the dimensions of the Figure i.e. for horizontal movement, a speed value of 50
    * would indicate move 50% of the Figure width every frame. Default is 5;

    * gravity is. If GRAVITY_DISABLED is passed in as a parameter, this is disregarded
    * no matter what value is passed in for gravity

    * strength. If GRAVITY_DISABLED is passed in as a parameter, this is disregarded

    * Parameter: int numClips describes the number of clips existing on the sprite sheet
    * for one single direction i.e. for the left direction, if there are four parts to
    * animate the left movement then numClips would be a value of 4. If this were the case,
